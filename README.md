	Name: My ecobee Init
	Description: My ecobee Init
	Categoy: My Apps
	Enable Oauth in Smartapp
	Click on Create at the bottom of the page
	Copy and paste the code from My ecobee Init
	https://github.com/yracine/device-type.myecobee/tree/master/smartapps

3) Use SmartSetup (+) from your phone or table within the smarttings app, 
	scroll right to to My Apps, execute My ecobee Init

5) Update device's preferences (optional)
	
        (a) <trace> when needed, set to true to get more tracing (no spaces)
        (b) <holdType> set to nextTransition or indefinite (by default, no spaces) 
        see https://www.ecobee.com/home/developer/api/documentation/v1/functions/SetHold.shtml for more details 

6) Your device should now be ready to process your commands

7) To populate the UI fields for your newly created device, please hit the 'refresh' button several times as the smartthings UI is not always responsive.  You may want to stop and restart your smartthings app if needed.

Optional (Smartapps available)

8) You can also use some of my smartapps that I've developed and adapt them according to your needs 

https://github.com/yracine/device-type.myecobee/tree/master/smartapps

Amongst others:

a) Monitor And Set Ecobee Temp

In brief, the smartapp allows automatic adjustments of the cooling/heating setpoints according to outdoor conditions. This is particularly useful in the Winter/Summer where outdoor temperature and humidity can vary throughout the day.

You can enable/disable the smartapp with a button on/off tile (ex.virtual switch).

The smartapp can use a outdoor sensor or a virtual weather station, such as

https://github.com/yracine/device-type.weatherstation8 

to get the oudoor temperature and humidity.



b) Monitor And Set Ecobee Humidity

Monitor humidity level indoor vs. outdoor at a regular intervals (in minutes) and 
set the humidifier/dehumidifier/HRV/ERV  to a target humidity level. 

c) ecobeeChangeMode

Change your ecobee climate (Away,Home) according to your hello home mode.

d) AwayFromHome and ecobeeResumeProg

Use presence sensors to set a target climate or heatin/cooling setpoints based on your presence/absence.
